# intro
    Probability is the logic of uncertainity.
    
# sample space
    mathematical framework of probablity is build around sets.
    The sample space S of an experiment is the set of all possible outcome of the experiment. An event E is subset of samle space S,
    and we say that E occured if the acutal outcome is in E
    
    The sample space of an experiment can be finite, countable infinite or uncountable infinite.
    cardinality of a set is a measure of the "number of elements" of the set.
    A infinite set is countable infinte if cardinality of the set match with cardinality as 
    the set of all positive integers else uncountable infinite
    
    
# Probability Axioms
    Axiom 1 :Probability is a real number greater or equal to 0.
    Axiom 2 :Total probability is equal to 1
    Axiom 3 :Probability of mutually exclusive events is the sum of the probabilities.
